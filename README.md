# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to gain insight into how the outcomes of theater campaigns on Kickstarter are related to launch date and goal size.  

This project looks at the correlation of two different factors to the outcomes of theater Kickstarter campaigns, as deliniated into successful, failed, or canceled. Launch date is examined with a sample size of 1,369 campaigns in the theater category. The data for campaign launch dates is spread from 2010 through 2017 and is charted by month. Goal size is analyzed with a sample size of 1,047 campaigns in the plays subcategory. The data for goal size ranges from under $1,000 to over $50,000, with groupings of $5,000 used for analysis. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
launch date info

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
goals info  
success greater than failure: 
	less than 1k: success margin of 51%
	1k to 15 k: steadily then sharply decreases from peak of 51%
	between 35k and 45k: 33%  
failure greater than success:
	50k or more: 75%
	
	
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
considerations of percentages and raw numbers  
outliers in the theater category for goal size due to space campaigns. removed for goals centered analysis, still present in launch date broader filter.  
live data not included 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
based on the use of raw numbers, we can see that the lowest time for successful campaigns coincides with the lowest overall number of campaigns launched (December)  
the month with the most successful campaign launches is May

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  
the most goal most likely to succeed are those under 5k 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
only one fundraising platform  
7 years  
1k sample size  
many more projects under 20k than above, skews goal %s bcs based on fewer values   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
compare average amount of backers and average backer contribution as a function of goal size, campaign type, launch date  
effect of spotlight on campaign success   
campaign length
